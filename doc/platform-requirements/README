Platform Requirements
=====================

TODO: document the various Linux specific features we currently require


Test Programs
-------------

In some places we rely on quite specific behaviour of sockets.
Although Linux, at least, seems to behave as required, It's not always
clear from the available documentation if this is required by POSIX or
some other specification.

To specifically document those expectations this directory has some
test programs which explicitly check for the behaviour we need.
When/if we attempt a port to a new platform, running these to check
behaviour would be a good place to start.
